\begin{frame}{Summary}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The proposed recognition system managed to detect all the 95 Euro banknotes in the 80 test images
		\item It was robust enough to handle folded and wrinkled banknotes with different kinds of illumination and perspective views
		\item The system is extensible to other banknote currencies and can also be used to detect planar objects besides banknotes (just requires a new image database)
		\item Future work would include the recognition of banknotes under ultra-violet / infra-red light and also the addition of a speech synthesizer
	\end{itemize}
